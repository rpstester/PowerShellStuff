# PowerShellStuff
Various PowerShell scripts and modules that may be useful to the public

My goal is to store and track changes on scripts that I have written, as long as they are generic and well-written.  I will not share company-specific information on here.  Hopefully, these can be useful in other contexts.  For example, Active Directory, Hyper-V, vmware, Office 365, file and print servers, etc.

My second goal is to get used to GitHub so that I can contribute with more quality to public projects.
